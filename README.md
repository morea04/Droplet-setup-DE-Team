# Setting Up a Droplet with Conda and Dagster on Digital Ocean

This guide will walk you through setting up a Digital Ocean droplet using SSH in Visual Studio Code, installing Conda, and setting up a project with Dagster and Dagit.

## Prerequisites

- A Digital Ocean account
- A droplet set up on Digital Ocean
- Visual Studio Code installed on your local machine
- SSH access to your droplet

## Step 1: Setting Up the Droplet Using SSH in VS Code

1. **Login through the Digital Ocean console**:
   - Access the console provided by Digital Ocean for your droplet.

2. **Follow the steps in this video to set up VS Code for SSH access**:
   - [Setup VS Code for SSH](https://youtu.be/r3t61OP5mWs?si=tkXhttYgXGOUSKNM)

Once you've completed the steps in the video, you should be able to connect to your droplet using VS Code. Now, you can proceed with setting up Conda.

## Step 2: Setting Up Conda Environment in the Droplet

1. **Download Conda**:
   ```sh
   curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

2. **Install Conda**:
   ```sh
   bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```
   Follow the on-screen instructions and provide access where needed.

3. **Remove the installation file**:
   ```sh
   rm ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

4. **Verify Conda installation**:
   ```sh
   conda --version
   ```
   If the version is displayed, Conda has been successfully installed.

## Step 3: Setting Up the Project in the Droplet

1. **Activate the base environment in Conda**:
   ```sh
   conda activate base
   ```

2. **Create a new environment for your project**:
   ```sh
   conda create --name my-project-env
   ```

3. **Activate the new environment**:
   ```sh
   conda activate my-project-env
   ```

4. **Install Dagster and Dagit**:
   ```sh
   pip install dagster dagit
   ```

5. **Create a new Dagster project**:
   ```sh
   dagster project scaffold --name my-dagster-project
   ```

6. **Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   cd my-dagster-project
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

7. **Launch the Dagster web server**:
   ```sh
   dagster-webserver
   ```

## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up a Digital Ocean droplet with SSH access through VS Code, installed Conda, created a new Conda environment, and set up a Dagster project. You can now start developing and running your data pipelines with Dagster.

## Additional Steps for Setting Up the Environment

### Install Conda

```sh
bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Follow the on-screen instructions and provide access where needed.

### Remove the installation file

```sh
rm ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

### Verify Conda installation

```sh
conda --version
```

If the version is displayed, Conda has been successfully installed.

### Setting Up the Project in the Droplet

Activate the base environment in Conda:

```sh
conda activate base
```

Create a new environment for your project:

```sh
conda create --name my-project-env
```

Activate the new environment:

```sh
conda activate my-project-env
```

Install Dagster and Dagit:

```sh
pip install dagster dagit
```

Create a new Dagster project:

```sh
dagster project scaffold --name my-dagster-project
```

Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

```sh
cd my-dagster-project
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Launch the Dagster web server:

```sh
dagster-webserver
```

## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up a Digital Ocean droplet with SSH access through VS Code, installed Conda, created a new Conda environment, and set up a Dagster project. You can now start developing and running your data pipelines with Dagster.
